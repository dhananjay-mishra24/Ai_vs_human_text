# Ai_vs_human_text

In this project, I have used a dataset from huggingface. 
The dataset can be obtained from "shahxeebhassan/human_vs_ai_sentences"

The major task is to classify a text whether that is written by human or generated by AI.

## Total models used - 
1. Using Logistic Regression
2. Using Decision Tree
3. Using Random Forest
4. Using Deep Learning model


## Performance
The highest performance was obtanied by Deep Learning model, while keeping Machine Learning models the Logistic Regression was having the best performace with accuracy of around 89%.
